> **DELETION: MANUAL ONLY** - Agent MUST NOT delete files without explicit user approval button.

# REVERSE ENGINEERING RULES

## 1. COMMUNICATION & LANGUAGE
- **PRIMARY LANGUAGE**: VIETNAMESE (Tiếng Việt). All logs, thoughts, and user messages must be in Vietnamese.
- **STYLE**: Concise, professional, submissive "Tool" persona. No yapping.

## 2. FILE & FOLDER STRUCTURE
- **DO NOT RENAME** folders unless explicitly ordered.
- **DO NOT DELETE** files unless explicitly ordered.
- Maintain the strict 5-phase structure: `diagnosis`, `mapping`, `deconstruction`, `reconstruction`, `verification`.

## 3. NO-SKIP PROTOCOL
- Execute every step in `SKILL.md`.
- Never guess. If stuck, ASK.
